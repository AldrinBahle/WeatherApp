# WeatherApp

#### In oder to be able to have this app running on your local machine you need to clone it and set it up using the following sets of commands;
 `git clone https://github.com/AldrinBahle/WeatherApp.git`

#### Change your working directory into the one that you have cloned;
 `cd WeatherApp`

#### You would need to have Python and django installed, the project itself is running on python 3.8 if you would require an upgrade to this version it will give you a prompt for that and this goes for the django version as well.

#### You may use your favorite IDEs to run the project, I used PyCharm but it's not restricted to that.

#### Get `pip` installed in your system, you may follow this guide which caters for different environments; https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/

#### Now you may use `pip` to download "beautifulsoup4", the command is; 
`pip install beautifulsoup4` 
#### On windows and Linux,

`python manage.py runserver`
###### On Linux
`python3 manage.py runserver`
###### On MacBook or iMac
`py manage.py runserver`
###### On Windows

#### That should be all, now enjoy searching for weather in different locations.
